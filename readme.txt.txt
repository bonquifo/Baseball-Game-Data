Hello! 


Sorry for the re-upload, exams plus I had forgotten to put my name on the folder. 

The actual game report is the html file titled: 'game_report2.html' while I have also supplied 

the python code that I had written it all in. In that code, there are other functions in there that I didn't

have time to finish thus unfortunately they're not shown, however I am confident they would've been able to 

strengthen my report of the game data. 



Thank you for reading this!
